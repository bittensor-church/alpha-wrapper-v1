# Alpha Wrapper: following the flow

A short guide to the wrapper's control flow.

## What lives where

```text
User's stake -> personal DepositMailbox -> shared SubnetClone
                         wrap                  |
                                              +-> alpha delegated to hotkeys
                                              +-> native TAO balance

AlphaVault: shares and accounting     IValidatorRegistry: target keys and weights
```

## Why there are several kinds of key

The registry names a validator, but a rename can move its stake elsewhere.

- `logical`: the name associated with a recorded slot.
- `active`: the last recorded location of its stake.
- `tracked`: the alpha expected at the last record update.
- `Backing.keys`: locations resolved now, possibly after following one swap.

Example: after A renames to B, the record can say `logical = A, active = B`.
Locating backing and choosing a receiver are separate checks: a receiving key
must also belong to the owner recorded when the validator was attested.

## The lifecycle

```text
Missing backing -> syncBacking secures located backing -> fixed recovery window
                       |
                       +-> recoverStray(source) -> collect into parking; window stays open
                       +-> full coverage + sync -> collect returns; recovery complete; parked
                       +-> expiry + sync -> collect returns; write off deficit; parked

Parked -> newer registry update -> next wrap/rebalance/alpha exit can
                                       apply the set and clear parked state
Parked -> live alpha or TAO exit leaves no shares -> parked state cleared
```

A detected shortfall blocks ordinary live deposits and exits. Collection must
succeed before the clock starts, except when every available pile is below the
conservative floor. Such dust can remain outside parking and be written off;
other move failures still revert. One pooled obligation replaces validator-specific
expectations during recovery; partial finds never extend the deadline. Time alone
never finalizes a write-off. Attestations do not move stake.

Parking blocks deposits and rebalancing until a newer registry update. Exits can use
parked backing, subject to execution checks. Transfers and accrued TAO claims
remain separate. Dissolution takes another path: exits wait through applicable
cleanup, then old shares redeem the clone's unreserved TAO.

## Follow a transaction

- **`createMailbox`:** resolve the live generation -> check the candidates -> deploy
  any missing subnet clone and personal mailbox -> initialize as own hotkey owner
  and verify locked-alpha rejection -> publish accepted addresses. All steps are atomic.
- **`wrap`:** require prepared addresses -> check backing, receivers and that the mailbox holds no lock ->
  collect the caller's mailbox stake at the chosen registry hotkey ->
  consolidate dropped keys -> align weights ->
  record actual balances -> calculate and mint shares. Collecting first lets a
  fresh deposit help move old dust; pricing uses the balances after movement.
- **Live `unwrap`:** check backing -> select destinations -> consolidate dropped
  keys -> price and burn shares -> gather and transfer staked alpha -> align the
  remainder -> update records. Check the recipient's actual credit against the
  minimum. A parked exit uses its recorded locations and skips weight alignment.
- **`unwrapForTao`:** check backing -> budget alpha and burn shares -> sell whole
  slots before partials -> measure proceeds and remaining alpha -> refund eligible
  unsold alpha as shares with proceeds reserved -> pay TAO. This path does not
  apply registry weights.
- **Dissolved `unwrap`:** exclude reserved TAO claims -> calculate a proportional
  refund -> burn shares -> pay native TAO. The caller must pass zero for `minAlphaOut`.

## Three details that explain surprising code

1. **Moving dust can require moving a large balance through it.** To collect 1
   unit at B into 100 at A, the code can move A's 100 to B, then 101 back to A.
   This clears a move minimum that the 1-unit transfer could not. Chain rounding
   requires fresh balance reads. Weight alignment may skip small moves.
2. **Minting, burning, and transferring also settle TAO.** `_update` synchronizes
   TAO and credits accounts using their old balances, changes shares, then resets
   their accounting debt. Accrued TAO stays with the account after its shares leave.
   A TAO sale pays before refund minting so proceeds do not enter that shared index.
3. **Reading and recording differ.** `_openBacking` resolves and checks without
   writing. `_settle` replaces the allocation record; `_reanchor` updates locations
   and balances while keeping slot identities.

Start tracing in `AlphaVault`. `VaultReads` resolves keys; `VaultAllocation`
moves stake. For recovery details, use the [runbook](hotkey-swaps.md).
