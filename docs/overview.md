# How it works

The wrapper keeps Bittensor alpha staked and issues transferable ERC-1155 shares.
A live position can normally redeem for staked alpha or sell it for native TAO.
Recovery, chain minimums and subnet state can temporarily prevent exits.

For a walkthrough of the implementation, read the
[source flow guide](source-flow-guide.md), covering the position lifecycle,
transaction ordering, and the separate alpha and TAO accounting.

## Contracts and addresses

- `AlphaVault`: deposits, shares, exits and permissionless maintenance. No vault
  admin; code, registry address, recovery window and parking hotkey are fixed
  at deployment. Its receiving-key rules, stake consolidation, payout gathering and
  weight alignment live in `VaultAllocation`, a library deployed once and linked into
  the vault's bytecode. The library also handles deposit admission and clone
  creation. Share accounting and backing gates remain in the vault.
- `AlphaVaultLens`: read-only backing and payout quotes. Use a trusted build paired
  with the vault; a quote does not guarantee transaction success.
- `SubnetClone`: one vault-controlled coldkey per subnet registration, isolating
  that position's stake and TAO from other positions.
- `DepositMailbox`: one accepted address per user and netuid. The vault only
  credits the caller's own mailbox.
- `CloneFactory`: a vault-owned deployer that checks each candidate account
  before deployment.
- `BasicValidatorRegistry`: one target hotkey per subnet at 100% weight, updated
  by its owner. Ownership transfers require the successor to accept. The vault
  also supports downstream weighted registries through `IValidatorRegistry`.

A token id is `(registrations << 16) | netuid`, where `registrations` is the
number of times the chain has registered that netuid. Reusing a dissolved netuid
steps it and creates a different token; old shares retain their old clone and
refund. A chain migration that rewrites a subnet's registration block leaves its
token unchanged.
`currentTokenId(netuid)` identifies the live generation. Users first call
`createMailbox(netuid, uid)` with a random 32-byte UID; the first call on a
generation also creates its subnet clone, which later users share. A poisoned
candidate is rejected and retried with another UID. Only the address the vault
publishes receives deposits.

## Share value and allocation

Alpha backing divided by supply determines share value, with virtual offsets to
limit first-depositor inflation. Emissions increase backing without minting shares.
The lens's `sharePrice` is alpha per share scaled by 1e18; `previewUnwrap` prices a
specific burn. Native TAO on the clone is accounted separately, not included in
the live alpha share price.

Wraps, alpha exits and `rebalance(netuid)` first consolidate dropped validators
and align stake toward current weights. An alpha exit pays before aligning the
remainder. Small alignment moves are skipped; current share value depends on total
backing, while allocation affects future emissions. TAO exits sell where stake
sits and do not rebalance.

## Swaps and recovery

The vault records where stake actually sits, separately from registry names.
It follows one successor hop from that recorded location and keeps allocation
under the coldkey that owned each attested name.

Unresolved swaps need a watcher. Missing backing is parked on a hotkey the
vault's own coldkey controls, by recovery or by a delayed write-off, and stays
parked until the registry owner publishes an update. A name claimed by a stranger
must be replaced with the intended validator. The example, watcher steps and exit restrictions are in
[Hotkey swaps and recovery](hotkey-swaps.md).
