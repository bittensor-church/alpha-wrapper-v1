# User guide

Use an EVM account on Bittensor with TAO for gas. Send transactions to the vault
and read quotes from its trusted `AlphaVaultLens`. Check that the lens's `vault()`
matches your vault; this detects a mismatched pair, not a dishonest lens.
See [How it works](overview.md) for the contract layout.

Alpha amounts use 9 decimals (RAO); native TAO amounts, including `minTaoOut`,
use 18-decimal EVM wei. One native RAO is 1e9 wei.

## Wrap staked alpha

1. Read `getCurrentValidators(netuid)` on the lens. The deposit must sit under a
   currently attested hotkey; move your stake there first if needed.
2. Call `createMailbox(netuid, uid)` with a fresh random `bytes32` UID. This
   creates your mailbox and, for the first user of this subnet generation, the
   shared subnet clone. If it reverts `CloneContaminated`, retry with a new UID.
3. Read `getDepositAddress(you, netuid)` from the vault, or take the addresses
   the call returns. Zero means creation has not succeeded yet.
4. Convert that EVM address to its Substrate coldkey using
   `addressMapping(address)` at `0x080C` (Frontier HashedAddressMapping).
5. Use Subtensor's `transfer_stake` to send alpha to that coldkey on the same
   subnet, retaining the chosen hotkey.
6. Call `wrap(netuid, chosenHotkey, minSharesOut)` from the same EVM account
   that created the mailbox.

One wrap collects one mailbox hotkey's balance. Use
`previewWrap(tokenId, assets)` to choose your minimum shares; a lower mint reverts
`SlippageExceeded`, leaving the deposit intact. Chain rounding can make execution
differ slightly from the preview. Zero waives the minimum.

After a netuid is recycled, call `createMailbox` again before wrapping its new
registration; your mailbox stays the same and the new subnet clone is created.
The first user on a generation pays for the shared clone as well as their
mailbox; later users pay for a mailbox. A public UID can be front-run, so a
failed creation can need another attempt.

A deposit below the vault's conservative stake floor reverts `DepositTooSmall`;
top up the mailbox before retrying. A mailbox holding conviction-locked alpha
reverts `LockedDeposit`; reclaim it with `reclaimAlphaFromMailbox` to a coldkey
that accepts locked alpha. Swaps and registry changes may need recovery first;
a quote alone does not check every transaction prerequisite.

## Shares and exits

Shares transfer as ERC-1155 balances. Keep the token id from `Deposited`:
`currentTokenId(netuid)` only identifies the live subnet generation.
`sharePrice(tokenId)` is alpha per share scaled by 1e18; use
`previewUnwrap(tokenId, shares)` for a specific burn.

### Staked alpha: the default exit

Call `unwrap(tokenId, shares, yourColdkey, minAlphaOut)`. The vault consolidates
dropped validators, pays staked alpha in one transfer, and aligns the remainder
toward current weights. This does not trade against the pool; chain rounding can
still cost a few RAO. Verify the destination coldkey: the chain pays the key you supply.

Choose `minAlphaOut` from `previewUnwrap` with only the rounding tolerance you
accept. It bounds actual recipient credit. Use at least `1` to refuse a zero-alpha
exit. Zero explicitly permits either:

- Burning shares for no alpha after a complete write-off, giving up their claim
  on later-recovered backing. Accrued TAO remains claimable.
- Receiving TAO instead after subnet dissolution.

### Native TAO: market sale

Call `unwrapForTao(tokenId, shares, minTaoOut)`. It sells backing from its actual
recorded keys, ignores registry weights, and pays your EVM account. Pool fees and
price impact reduce proceeds; sales also lower the pool price for remaining holders.
Prefer the alpha exit when available.

There is no TAO market-sale preview. `minTaoOut` bounds execution proceeds in wei.
Unsold alpha is refunded as shares, except that a burn of the entire token supply
discards a sub-floor remainder. A sale yielding nothing reverts `WithdrawTooSmall`.

A recorded slot the pool will not pay for, such as a few RAO left behind by
rounding, makes the plain call fail, and a refused chain call burns the gas it
was given. `unwrapForTao(tokenId, shares, minTaoOut, excludedSlots)` sells
around it: bit `i` of the mask leaves out slot `i` of `recordedSlots(tokenId)`
as the record stands when the call runs. Your entitlement still counts every
slot, and what an excluded slot would have sold comes back as shares. Before a
TAO exit, quote each recorded slot's balance with `simSwapAlphaForTao` on the
alpha precompile through `eth_call`, where a refused quote costs nothing,
exclude the slots that fail or quote zero, then dry-run the masked call the
same way; `scripts/plan_tao_exit.py` does exactly this, quoting each slot from
the key the vault would sell it from, which it reads off the lens. Quotes are
taken one at a time and earlier sales move the pool, so the dry run is the real
check, and a state change between it and inclusion can still call for one retry.

A full-supply burn uses floor-exempt full stake drains. This is not an unconditional
exit guarantee: ownership, backing, pool execution and slippage checks still apply.
A small holder with co-holders may need a top-up or combine shares with another
holder to clear minimums. Top-ups themselves may need watcher recovery first.

### Dissolved subnet

After cleanup, `unwrap(tokenId, shares, anything, 0)` pays your share of the clone's
TAO refund; the coldkey argument is unused. `previewUnwrap` quotes that TAO amount.
Payouts floor to whole RAO; a smaller slice reverts `ClaimBelowNativePrecision`.
A positive alpha minimum prevents a transaction prepared for alpha from unexpectedly
burning for TAO. See [dissolution](edge-cases.md#subnet-dissolution).

## Recovery status

On a live subnet, `BackingShortfall` blocks wraps, rebalances, both exits and value
quotes until the position parks or the loss is written off. It means expected
alpha is unlocated, not proof it was destroyed. While a loss is on file the
token stays shut (`ShortfallOnFile`) until recovery completes or sync writes
off the remaining deficit. Shares still transfer and accrued TAO stays claimable.

The lens exposes:

- `locatedStake(tokenId)`: alpha currently found.
- `missingStake(tokenId)`: the aggregate alpha still missing.
- `isBackingIntact(tokenId)`: whether all recorded expectations are covered and
  no loss is on file.
- `frozenUntil(tokenId)`: zero while the position accounts for itself, the
  maximum value while a shortfall is still undeclared, otherwise the deadline
  at which `syncBacking` can write the loss off.
- `awaitingAttestation(tokenId)`: whether the position still waits for an
  attestation newer than the one it parked under. It turns false the moment a
  newer set is published, while the alpha keeps sitting on the parking hotkey,
  earning nothing, until the first wrap, rebalance or alpha exit moves it.

A parked position pays alpha exits from the parking hotkey: the alpha arrives
delegated to that hotkey and earns nothing until you move it to a validator
with your own `moveStake`. TAO exits, transfers and claims work as usual.
Deposits (`Parked`) and weight alignment wait for the attesters to publish a
new validator set; the first wrap, rebalance or alpha exit after that lands the
parked alpha on the new set.

`syncBacking` parks located backing before starting one fixed window.
`recoverStray(tokenId, source)` then collects one hotkey per call without changing
the deadline. Call sync again after full recovery to clear the freeze. At expiry,
sync collects returns before writing off the remaining deficit.
Below-floor piles may remain outside parking and be written off without delaying
the window. A larger return can collect that dust; after write-off its location
must be supplied explicitly to `recoverStray`. Other collection failures revert
without changing the obligation or clock.
An intact backing report does not guarantee an exit either. See the
[watcher runbook](hotkey-swaps.md).

## Claim TAO and reclaim deposits

Native TAO received by a live clone outside exits is indexed to holders when
synchronized. Read `claimableTaoOf(you, tokenId)`; call
`claimTao(tokenId, recipient)` to collect it. Claims survive share transfers and
full exits; sub-RAO residue stays reserved.

Mailbox recovery always acts on your own mailbox:

- `reclaimAlphaFromMailbox(netuid, hotkey, destColdkey)`: return staked alpha,
  including from unlisted hotkeys.
- `reclaimMailboxAlphaAsTao(netuid, hotkey, minTaoOut)`: sell it for native TAO.
- `reclaimTaoFromMailbox(netuid)`: collect native TAO, including dissolution refunds.

Stake recovery still depends on source ownership and chain rules. Disabled alpha
transfers prevent the first method, not the TAO sale itself.

If a swap moved your deposit, wrapping the old key can revert `ZeroAmount`.
Locate the mailbox's stake from chain state/history, reclaim from its actual key,
then redeposit under a currently attested hotkey.
