# Security model

## Authority and trust

The vault has no admin or upgrade path. Only it can drive its mailbox and subnet
clones. `BasicValidatorRegistry` has one owner choosing a single hotkey per subnet
at 100% weight. OpenZeppelin two-step ownership transfers require the nominated
successor to accept; the existing owner retains authority until then. Renunciation
is disabled. Downstream registries may supply different governance and weighted
sets through `IValidatorRegistry`.

The registry owner cannot directly withdraw backing, mint/burn users' shares,
access their mailboxes or change vault code.

If the `BasicValidatorRegistry` owner loses access without an accessible pending
successor, registry updates stop permanently. Parked positions cannot be released:
deposits and rebalancing remain blocked, though exits remain available. An
ownership transfer alone does not advance registry nonces; the new owner must
publish a validator update to release parking.

Registry choices affect emissions and transaction availability. The TAO exit
ignores registry weights, but cannot bypass source ownership, missing backing,
dissolution, chain minimums or pool constraints. A hostile set is not harmless
merely because that exit exists.

**Each integrator is responsible for choosing and governing its validator policy
and for assessing the resulting economic, legal, regulatory and liability risks
for its service and jurisdiction.**

Holders rely on:

- Subtensor and its precompiles for stake ownership, moves, accounting and refunds.
  Creation requires `getHotkeyOwner`, `getOwnedHotkeys`, `getColdkeyRoot`,
  `getColdkeyLock`, `getRejectLockedAlpha` and
  `tryAssociateHotkey`. The lineage and ownership readers must reflect current
  runtime storage; an unsupported runtime cannot prepare clones.
- Registry governance and validator performance.
- A funded, responsive watcher to repair unresolved swaps and park backing, and
  an authorized registry update to release a parked position. Watcher calls are
  permissionless; registry updates require authorization. Neither is guaranteed on-chain.
- Trusted vault/lens builds and addresses. The lens's `vault()` checks pairing,
  not authenticity.

## Safeguards

- Separate clones isolate each subnet registration's backing.
- Mailbox collection only credits its depositor; outsiders cannot collect it.
- Stake-moving and native-payout entry points are non-reentrant. Share changes
  checkpoint claimable TAO before recipient acceptance callbacks.
- Virtual shares/assets limit first-depositor inflation; a supply cap protects
  claim-index precision.
- Caller-selected minimum outputs make insufficient fills revert atomically.
- Unresolved backing blocks live pricing and exits until the position parks or
  the loss is written off; recovery moves only the vault's own stake, onto a
  hotkey only the vault's coldkey controls.
- A receiving key is usable only under the coldkey that owned the registry-listed name;
  a name claimed by anyone else receives nothing.
- Alpha exits avoid pool trades. TAO exits are opt-in market sales with fees and
  price impact, including price impact borne by remaining holders.
- Mailboxes and subnet clones are checked and protected at creation, so locked
  alpha never backs a share.

## Why clone contamination matters

A coldkey swap can plant locks, account settings and ownership roles on any
account that stakes nothing, including a future mailbox or subnet clone, without
its consent. A poisoned mailbox blocks its user's deposit. Locked alpha priced
as backing would let an attacker mint shares and exit with honest holders'
unlocked alpha, leaving them alpha that neither exit can move.

- Creation checks the candidate chosen by the caller's UID for code, ownership,
  swap history and locks, rejects a poisoned one so the caller retries with a
  fresh UID, then has the clone claim its own account as a hotkey it owns. The
  chain refuses coldkey swaps into existing hotkeys, so the protection holds at
  zero stake, and a clone has no function that could rename or hand over that
  hotkey. Creation also verifies that the clone rejects locked-alpha transfers.
- An unexpected lock fails closed: a locked mailbox cannot be wrapped, and a
  locked subnet clone stops prices, deposits, alignment and exits until the lock
  clears. Recovery reads and accrued TAO claims stay available.

The cost is one creation transaction per user; the first user of a subnet
generation also pays for the shared clone. A UID is public once submitted, so a
front-run creation can fail and need a retry with a new UID. Ordinary
unlocked-alpha and TAO donations remain allowed.

## Recovery-window tradeoff and late-recovery attack

The [hotkey-swap runbook](hotkey-swaps.md) separates two failures: names that
answer to the wrong coldkey and unlocated alpha. A registry update repairs the first.
`syncBacking` handles the second: it moves all located backing onto the vault's
parking hotkey before starting one fixed recovery window, with a dust exception:
if even the richest source or parking balance is below the conservative movement
floor, collection leaves those balances in place without delaying the window.
Every sync retries collection before write-off, so a larger return or price rise
can bring the dust home. Other collection failures revert without changing the
clock or obligation; persistent chain restrictions can still delay recovery.
A native precompile refusal consumes forwarded gas, even though state rolls back.

The conservative floor uses `DefaultMinStake`: 0.002 TAO in [Subtensor `14cde6410`](https://github.com/opentensor/subtensor/blob/14cde6410fe8ec81a940e290c56f94a632a0988d/runtime/src/lib.rs#L841),
20 times its 0.0001 TAO same-subnet transfer minimum. Thus some chain-movable
balances can be skipped and written off. Ten skipped locations expose less than
0.02 TAO at the floor check's price, not at a future price. Using the lower
transfer minimum is a separate compatibility change.

Recovery counts one expected total and one pool of located alpha, without assigning
finds to validators. After sync declares a loss, `recoverStray(tokenId, source)`
parks one source per call. Only sync finalizes recovery, collecting returns at
recorded locations first. Neither call extends the clock.
Validator swaps cannot move the secured balance off the vault-owned parking hotkey.
At expiry, sync collects returns before writing off the remaining deficit,
including any dust still outside parking. The dust exposure is per skipped
location, valued at the floor check's price; it is not a bound on future alpha
value. A movable pile gathers smaller balances too. Late dust recovery requires
explicit source keys and belongs to holders at that later time.
Full recovery or write-off leaves the position parked pending a newer registry update.

Write-off chooses repricing over indefinite waiting for missing alpha. It is a
real loss of accounted backing for holders at finalization, not proof the alpha
was destroyed. Any later recovery belongs to whoever holds shares then.

A validator can exploit that policy:

1. Swap its hotkey, carrying vault alpha, then re-register the old key on the
   subnet to erase the successor edge.
2. If watchers cannot park the funded key in time, finalize the write-off.
3. Once the registry authority publishes again, deposit against the reduced backing to
   acquire a larger share of the supply.
4. Reveal/recover the hidden alpha, or have a later registry update and settlement
   count it. The new shares now participate in that recovery.

For hidden principal `H` with no growth, the original holders' aggregate loss
from this ordering is bounded by `H`: it reallocates the late recovery, rather
than also extracting another `H` from located backing. Emissions or surplus on
the hidden key can make the later windfall exceed the `BackingWrittenOff` amount.
After write-off, deposits stay shut while shares remain until the registry is
updated. A full exit to zero supply also clears parking and reopens deposits;
no shares remain to dilute.

This is accepted policy and a reason to park before write-off. Afterward,
neither `recoverStray` nor a new registry update reconstructs the old holders' claims.
Following a complete write-off, a zero-floor `unwrap` voluntarily burns worthless
shares and gives up their claim on future recovery. A positive floor preserves
them; accrued TAO survives either way.

## Other accepted limits

- Watcher-assisted recovery permits temporary exit failures, including with intact
  backing. The contract does not skip required alpha-exit alignment to avoid them.
- Stake minimums and rounding can require top-ups or combining shares. A full
  TAO exit may discard sub-floor unsold residue.
- Partial TAO exits can refund unsold alpha as shares; `minTaoOut` bounds the payout,
  not the pool-price effect on remaining holders.
- A mailbox deposit moved by a swap needs manual reclaim and redeposit if its
  actual key is no longer listed in the registry.
- A parked position earns no emissions until the registry authority publishes a new set.
  A validator can swap and re-register its old key to cut a successor edge the
  vault still needs. After an all-subnet swap, anyone paying the burn can register
  that ownerless key on the affected token's subnet if registration is open; see the
  [watcher runbook](hotkey-swaps.md#watcher-runbook).
- Clone protection relies on the chain refusing coldkey swaps into existing
  hotkeys and rejecting locked-alpha transfers by default. A public UID can be
  front-run into a retry; a poisoned candidate never becomes backing.
