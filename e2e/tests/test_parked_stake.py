"""A funded hotkey loses its owner; the owner replaces the name and the vault claims the key.

A validator moves its identity to a new hotkey while its stake stays behind. The old
hotkey then has no owner record, so the chain would refuse to move alpha off it, and
the attested name no longer answers to the coldkey that was attested. The vault keeps
the position quotable but refuses partial exits until the owner publishes a set that
names the successor. The next exit then claims the abandoned key for the vault's own
coldkey, rolls the stake onto the successor and pays the holder, with no watcher and
no subnet re-registration involved.
