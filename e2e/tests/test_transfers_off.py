"""Scenario: alpha transfers switched off.

When a subnet's alpha transfers are disabled, the chain refuses to move
staked alpha between wallets but still allows selling it for TAO. The
vault's alpha rail (which delivers by moving staked alpha) is therefore
closed, but both TAO-rail exits still pay out: they only ever sell alpha
for TAO.

  Phase 6   seed a wrapped position in the deposit clone (transfers ON)
  Phase 7   seed raw alpha in the user's mailbox (transfers ON)
  Phase 8   switch alpha transfers OFF on every subnet and confirm the chain
            now refuses a raw stake transfer
  Phase 9   the alpha rail is closed: unwrap reverts with shares intact
  Phase 10  withdraw the deposit clone as TAO (unwrapForTao), payout on quote
  Phase 11  withdraw the mailbox itself as TAO (reclaimMailboxAlphaAsTao),
            payout on quote
