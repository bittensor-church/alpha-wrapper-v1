"""Scenario: TAO the chain strands on the vault becomes claimable by holders.

When the chain's dust threshold is raised by governance, small stake entries
are force-sold and the vault's subnet account receives native TAO that no
vault operation paid out. The vault must credit exactly the holders present
at that moment, let them withdraw it, and give none of it to later
depositors.

The threshold raise clears sub-threshold nominations on EVERY subnet and
force-sells the vault's whole (deliberately tiny) position. Nothing on chain
records that as the cause, and a hotkey swap whose edge the chain has since
dropped looks identical, so the vault will not guess: it holds the expectation
and shuts the alpha rails for a recovery window. The test restores the threshold
it found, puts the loss on file with no quorum involved, and leaves the token to
its window rather than pretending the position can be retired inside it.
