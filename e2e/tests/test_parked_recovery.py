"""A stranger cuts the trail behind a validator's rename; the watcher parks the position.

A validator renames its hotkey on every subnet, which moves the vault's alpha to the
new name and records the edge the vault follows. Before the vault records that, a
stranger renames a junk key onto the vacated name: the chain lets anyone claim a name
with no owner, and the rename erases the name's own edge. The vault can no longer find
the alpha and refuses every priced operation.

The watcher calls `syncBacking`, recovers the successor with `recoverStray`, and syncs
again. Backing rests on the vault's parking hotkey, and the vault holds
deposits and weight alignment shut until the owner publishes a set without the
vacated name. Exits keep working from the parking hotkey throughout.
